## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: Users authenticate via Replit OIDC â†’ Session creation â†’ User profile association with village
2. **Emergency Reporting**: Location capture â†’ Emergency type selection â†’ Database storage â†’ Real-time broadcast via WebSocket
3. **Alert Distribution**: Admin creates alert â†’ Village targeting â†’ Database storage â†’ WebSocket notification â†’ SMS delivery (if enabled)
4. **Real-time Updates**: Database changes â†’ WebSocket broadcast â†’ Client cache invalidation â†’ UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL serverless for scalable data storage
- **Authentication**: Replit OIDC for secure user authentication
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (ws library) for live updates
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for modern, accessible UI components

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin for fast development
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and type checking

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Server**: Node.js development server with tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Client**: Vite development server with hot module replacement
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for development and production
- **Build Process**: Vite builds client, esbuild bundles server for production

### Production Build
- **Client Build**: Vite creates optimized static assets in `dist/public`
- **Server Build**: esbuild creates bundled Node.js application in `dist`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves client assets in production mode
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for Neon connection, SESSION_SECRET for security

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Client, server, and shared schemas in single repository for better code sharing and type safety
2. **Type-First Approach**: Shared TypeScript schemas ensure consistency between frontend and backend
3. **Real-time First**: WebSocket integration for immediate emergency response capabilities
4. **Village-Centric Design**: Geographic organization around Cyprus villages for localized emergency management
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with real-time features
6. **Security-First**: Session-based authentication with secure cookie handling and CSRF protection
7. **Scalable Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL with efficient indexing for emergency response speed
